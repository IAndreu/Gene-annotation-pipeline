In this directory called "Genomes" is where all the genomes that have to be annotated must be placed in a folder with their name and all the required files inside. Example:

Genomes/Genome-name1/files
Genomes/Genome-name2/files
Genomes/Genome-name3/files
...

Where "files" are:
- File with genomic sequences in FASTA format
- File with structural annotations in GFF3 format
- File with predicted proteins in FASTA format.
- File with predicted domains from InterPro in TSV format
